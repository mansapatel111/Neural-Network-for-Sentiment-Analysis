# Neural-Network-for-Sentiment-Analysis

Developed a feedforward neural network for sentiment classification, achieving 95% accuracy on the training data.

Preprocessed text data using TF-IDF vectorization and transformed book reviews into numerical vectors for model training.

Implemented a 3-layer neural network with ReLU activation for hidden layers and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.

Optimized the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and tuned the learning rate to enhance performance.

Utilized early stopping techniques and monitored validation accuracy to prevent overfitting, improving model generalization on unseen data.

Visualized training and validation loss/accuracy over 80 epochs, enhancing insight into model performance and convergence.
